This shell-like structure is made of a mineral formula that is seceted by the octopus using two of its arms. The shell-like structure can grow to nearly a foot in length and can hold more than 40,000 embryos. The argonaut octopus crawls inside its shell-like purse, traps some air bubbles inside, then uses its buoyancy to bob just beneath the surface of water in warm oceans around the world.\nThe argonaut octopus has evolved this ability independently, and not by reactivating archaic genes from the mollusk era. The argonaut octopus&#8217;s shell-like egg case didn&#8217;t evolve from the ancestral shell, but it is the argonauts’ own evolutionary innovation for a new purpose.\nThe findings also feed into a debate over whether the argonaut’s egg case should really be called a shell. Michael Vecchione of the National Museum of Natural History wishes people wouldn&#8217;t call it a shell because there’s a major difference in how it’s constructed.\nOther mollusks make their shells with mantle tissue secreted by a gland, Dr. Vecchione said, whereas the arm tips of A. argo secrete the argonaut’s shell material.\nHe hopes these novel findings will finally convince people to stop calling it a shell and start a rebrand.\nBeyond the shell debate, Dr. Setiamarga and colleagues’ new genome sequence may help scientists understand more about how argonauts evolved to be pelagic, or living in open waters, and not benthic, like other octopuses who prefer the depths.</li>\n</ul>\n",

Finally, both of the objects involved in the merger were relatively massive: about 50 and 80 times the mass of the Sun.
