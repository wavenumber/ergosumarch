The complexity of dog breeding over hundreds of years has left its mark in the genomes of different breeds, making it difficult to trace the genetic origins of behaviours. The study identified 10 distinct canine lineages and mapped behavioural traits to them, finding that sheepdogs, for example, tended to show predatory behaviour and aggression towards other dogs, while toy dogs tended to be nervous.

Proust&#8217;s work, In Search of Lost Time, was an ambitious four-thousand-page reconstruction of a life and a world, touching on the Dreyfus affair, anti-Semitism, and French nationalism. Finding Time Again, the final volume, was written in a new style due to the author&#8217;s failing health and the effects of World War I. The Modern Library editors used the work of Andreas Mayor, which was often colored by heavy editorial hand. In the book, Proust&#8217;s errors are often allowed to stand, and there is a sense of haste, due to the author&#8217;s pain and guilt over Alfred Agostinelli&#8217;s death and his own inversion.

Proust&#8217;s work, In Search of Lost Time, was an ambitious four-thousand-page reconstruction of a life and a world, touching on the Dreyfus affair, anti-Semitism, and French nationalism.
