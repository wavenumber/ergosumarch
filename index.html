<ul>
<li>For the first time, scientists have observed quantum interference, a wavelike interaction between particles related to the phenomenon of entanglement, between two different kinds of particles. This discovery, made at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory, could help physicists understand the inside of an atomic nucleus. The interference occurs because of entanglement and occurs when two dissimilar particles become entangled. The new technique allows researchers to measure the size and shape of a nucleus to a tenth of the size of a proton, and also to get a clearer look at the gluons that hold quarks together.</li>

<ul>
<li>Researchers have found evidence that ancient stone tools discovered in Brazil were made by capuchin monkeys, not early humans, as previously thought. Through the comparison of the tools found at Pedra Furada to those made by capuchin monkeys today, the researchers found that there was no difference between the tools from 50,000 years ago and those produced by monkeys today. Furthermore, there was no evidence of human presence in the area, such as hearths or dietary remains. This suggests that the tools were the product of capuchin monkeys breaking nuts and rocks, 50,000 years before the present.</li>

<ul>
<li>Researchers from the Laboratory for Coherent Manipulation of Atoms and Light (LMCAL) at the University of São Paulo&#8217;s Physics Institute (IF-USP) have developed a light source that produces two entangled light beams. The source is an optical parametric oscillator (OPO) typically made up of a non-linear optical response crystal between two mirrors forming an optical cavity. When a bright green beam shines on the apparatus, the crystal-mirror dynamics produces two light beams with quantum correlations. The researchers then used a detection technique to show that the beams were indeed entangled, with the entanglement structure being richer than would typically be characterized. This kind of light source could have potential applications in encryption, communications, quantum computing, and metrology, as well as enhancing the sensitivity of atomic magnetometers used to measure the alpha waves emitted by the human brain.</li>

<ul>
<li>The Demon Core was a 6.2 kilogram sphere of plutonium and gallium which was created for the purpose of being used in a nuclear attack on Japan that never happened. Two scientists, Harry Daghlian and Louis Slotin, died from radiation poisoning as a result of accidents involving the core during experiments. As a result, new safety protocols were put in place to protect scientists from the dangers of working with the core. The Demon Core was eventually melted down and reintegrated into the US nuclear stockpile. It is notable for the eerie coincidence of the two accidents taking place on Tuesdays, the 21st day of the month, and both scientists dying in the same hospital room.</li>

<ul>
<li>Chemists have been trying to move away from palladium due to the expense of separating out and disposing of the hazardous waste it produces. Researchers hope to replace palladium with more common metals like iron and nickel, or invent metal-free catalysts. However, the search for alternatives has been fraught with difficulties due to the ubiquity of palladium. Researchers have frequently reported finding palladium-free catalysts only to later find out that it was palladium contamination that was responsible for the results. Despite the difficulties, researchers are still pursuing alternatives to palladium as they hope to find new ways of building molecules without it.</li>

<ul>
<li>Nan Madol is an enigmatic ancient ruin site located on the shores of the Micronesian island of Pohnpei, consisting of dozens of small artificial islands separated by canals that are flushed by the tides. A team of researchers has proposed that the island is slowly sinking due to plate tectonics, which would explain why the site was above sea level when it was built. The researchers also suggest that the islands between the northern and southern Polynesian expansion routes were originally underwater, making them difficult to settle, and that Nan Madol may have been built by descendants of the first wave of settlers.</li>

<ul>
<li>The Leaning Tower of Pisa, which had been tilting due to its shoddy foundations, has not only stopped its tilt but is gradually untilting itself. An international committee has found that after 21 years of stabilization work, the tower is now leaning even less than expected, having lost 4 cm of its tilt. In addition, the tower is now more stable and moves less than expected. The Tower of Pisa was originally closed to the public in 1990 due to its 5.5 degree lean, but after 10 years of work and 70 metric tons of soil removed, the tower&#8217;s lean was reduced to 3.99% degrees and was 19 inches straighter. The tower has since been monitored regularly and is in a much better state than before.</li>

<li>This study from Johns Hopkins University found that the speed at which our eyes flick from one option to another when presented with two choices predicts the ultimate decision we make. This eye movement, called a saccade, is involuntary and can be measured in a few seconds to reveal how much we prefer one option over the other. Neurons in the frontal eye field and the parietal cortex ramp up activity when people are engaged in decision-making, which increases the speed of the eye movements. This provides a non-invasive way to measure decisions in real-time.</li>

<ul>
<li>Researchers at Tsinghua have recently carried out a study exploring why the detection of entanglement in complex and noisy systems is so difficult. Their findings, published in Physical Review Letters, suggest a trade-off between the effectiveness and efficiency of entanglement detection methods. Their theoretical considerations showed that detecting entanglement in large-scale and noisy quantum systems is difficult due to the need to control all interactions in the system with high precision and to know almost all information about them. They also found that the effectiveness of entanglement detection protocols decreases exponentially with the size of the system, and that no entanglement detection protocols are both efficient and effective. The results of this research can help inform the design of entanglement detection protocols for future use.</li>

<li>It discusses a breakthrough device developed by a team of French researchers which uses a cloud of cooled rubidium atoms to measure acceleration without using satellite signals. The atoms are exposed to laser pulses which creates two matter waves that can interfere with one another. This interference is measured against a reference, and the shift in interference fringes can be used to calculate acceleration. The device is highly precise and does not require external signals, but is currently too large and expensive for practical use.</li>

<ul>
<li>Dr. Rishi Rajpopat has solved a grammatical problem that has been unresolved since the 5th century BC. By decoding a rule taught by &#8220;the father of linguistics,&#8221; Pāṇini, Rajpopat has made it possible to construct millions of grammatically correct words in Sanskrit, including &#8220;mantra&#8221; and &#8220;guru.&#8221; His discovery has been described as &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; and could now mean that Pāṇini&#8217;s grammar can be taught to computers for the first time. Rajpopat&#8217;s discovery shows that Pāṇini&#8217;s &#8220;language machine&#8221; is self-sufficient, and that his metarule means that when there is a conflict between two rules, the one applicable to the right side of the word should be chosen. This interpretation produces grammatically correct words with almost no exceptions. Rajpopat&#8217;s discovery could revolutionize the study of Sanskrit, and has implications for teaching computers how to produce human speech.</li>

<li>The ALICE collaboration has published an article in Nature Physics that presents the first measurement of the rate at which antihelium&#8211;3 nuclei disappear when they interact with normal matter. This data has been used to estimate the transparency of the Milky Way to light antimatter nuclei, which is important for understanding their propagation in the Galaxy and for guiding space- and balloon-based searches for dark matter. The transparency was estimated to be 50% for antinuclei originating from dark matter, and 25&#8211;90% for cosmic-ray collisions, depending on energy. This suggests that antinuclei can travel long distances in the Milky Way without being absorbed.</li>

<ul>
<li>US scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory have achieved a breakthrough in fusion energy, producing a net energy gain in a reaction for the first time. This could provide a reliable and abundant source of zero-carbon energy, and could help to reduce global energy prices and emissions. The experiment involved bombarding a tiny pellet of hydrogen plasma with the world’s biggest laser, and produced about 2.5 megajoules of energy. Analysis of the results is still ongoing, and a major scientific breakthrough will be announced on Tuesday. If this is confirmed, it would be a historic moment as scientists have been attempting to achieve net energy gain since the 1950s. Investment into fusion power has grown significantly in recent years, and the potential breakthrough has been described as &#8220;game-changing&#8221; by industry leaders.</li>

<li>Père Lachaise cemetery in Paris is world-famous for being the resting place of famous writers, musicians, artists and thinkers. Since the ban on pesticides in parks and cemeteries in Paris, and since lockdown in March/April 2020, biodiversity has greatly increased in the cemetery. Benoît Gallot, the cemetery&#8217;s curator, has been sharing photos of the wildlife that reside among the tombs and giving a glimpse into the secret, vibrant life at the Parisian landmark. He has also published a book, La Vie Secrète d’un Cimetière (The Secret Life of a Cemetery), to demonstrate the positive side of death, which is still a taboo subject in France. Gallot has been responsible for maintaining the plots, some of which are historical monuments, and for making sure that the 4,000 trees and 1,000 shrubs are kept safe. 100 plots become available in Père Lachaise each year, and the two-square-metre plots cost more than 15,000 euros. Père Lachaise is a multifaceted cemetery, with people from all over the world sending Gallot items such as books and poems.</li>

<li>This study combined data from 46,000 answers to questions about canine behaviour and DNA sequences from over 4,000 dogs, including wild and domestic, to pinpoint genetic variants linked to certain behaviours. The complexity of dog breeding over hundreds of years has left its mark in the genomes of different breeds, making it difficult to trace the genetic origins of behaviours. The study identified 10 distinct canine lineages and mapped behavioural traits to them, finding that sheepdogs, for example, tended to show predatory behaviour and aggression towards other dogs, while toy dogs tended to be nervous. Analysis of the associated DNA variants revealed a molecular pathway involved in forming connections between nerve cells, with potential implications for research into the biological basis of human behaviours.</li>

<ul>
<li>The amyloid cascade hypothesis proposed that amyloid plaques were the cause of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, and this idea led to a collective goal of targeting the plaques and getting rid of them as a remedy. However, despite the lack of useful results, alternative models were largely ignored in favor of the amyloid explanation. After more research, it is now becoming clear that the amyloid cascade hypothesis is not the only factor involved in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and that targeting amyloid could still lead to effective therapeutic treatments. The current focus is now on exploring small molecules that can penetrate into the cell and inhibit the enzymes that generate amyloid-beta.</li>

<ul>
<li>This study reveals that the northern tip of Greenland was home to mastodons, reindeer, and lush forests 2 million years ago, which is surprising given the region&#8217;s current barren landscape. Through extraction and sequencing of ancient DNA from frozen soil samples from the Kap København Formation, the research team was able to identify the species present in the ancient ecosystem, which included poplar, spruce and yew trees, as well as reindeer and mastodons. The findings suggest that past ecosystems can be differently composed than expected, and that organisms are capable of adapting to changing climates.</li>

<ul>
<li>A recent discovery of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) lasting nearly two minutes, called GRB 211211A, has challenged the long-standing assumption that longer GRBs are the distinctive signature of a supernova. Scientists have identified the source as a &#8220;kilonova,&#8221; triggered by the merger of two neutron stars, which was previously assumed to only produce short GRBs. This hybrid event of a kilonova with a long GRB is surprising, and suggests that gamma-ray bursts are much more difficult to classify than previously thought. GRB 221009A, the most powerful gamma-ray burst yet recorded, could be the &#8220;birth cry&#8221; of a new black hole. There are two types of gamma-ray bursts: short and long; short-term GRBs last less than two seconds and are thought to come from neutron-star mergers, while long GRBs can last several minutes to hours and are thought to come from supernovae. GRB 211211A was relatively close at 1 billion light-years away, and analysis revealed a kilonova signature. This could offer a new way of studying how heavy elements like gold and platinum form in our universe.</li>

<li>Researchers have found evidence of an asymmetry in the arrangement of galaxies in the sky, an effect that could point to unknown fundamental laws that operated during the Big Bang. When counting tetrahedra made up of four galaxies, the researchers found that tetrahedra oriented one way outnumber their mirror images. This is known as parity violation, and could be related to the matter-antimatter asymmetry puzzle. To test this hypothesis, physicists are looking for further evidence of parity violation in other data sets, and are studying inflation models that could have produced the signal.</li>

<ul>
<li>The Hand of Irulegi, an ancient bronze artefact discovered near Pamplona, has recently been identified as the oldest written example of Proto-Basque and has the potential to help scholars trace the development of the mysterious Basque language. Until now, scholars believed that the Vascones, an iron age tribe from whom modern Basque is thought to descend, were largely illiterate and only began writing after the Romans introduced the Latin alphabet. However, the five words written in 40 characters that were identified as Vasconic suggest otherwise, with the first word being a forerunner of the modern Basque word for &#8216;good luck&#8217;. Experts studying the artefact believe that it could change the way scholars look at the Vascones, as it indicates that they had a written language. Although the discovery is significant, caution should be used when extrapolating too many conclusions from it.</li>

<li>Publishers are testing prototypes of automatic systems to detect submitted manuscripts that may contain fabricated data and images. The tools are part of an online integrity hub which is being developed by the International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers in collaboration with 24 publishing companies. The hub will provide tools to editors to check submitted articles for research-integrity issues and will include two tools: one to scan papers for signals which could indicate a paper mill, and another to alert editors when a paper is submitted to multiple journals. The hub will also include an image-detection software and provide workshops for publishers to share information and learn from each other. It is funded by an initial, undisclosed, investment by STM, and operational costs will be recovered via a fee for integrating the hub into the publishers&#8217; editorial systems.</li>

<li>Physicists have not created a real wormhole in a lab, nor have they studied quantum gravity in a lab. They have, however, made a baby step toward simulating a &#8220;toy model&#8221; of a wormhole in a lab. This method is analogous to trying to learn about the origin of life or consciousness through simulations. It is not the real thing and may lead to a simulation of a real wormhole in the distant future, but will never lead to making a real wormhole.

<li>This article describes the rediscovery of a pre-Hispanic mural in Lambayeque, Peru that was believed to have been destroyed by looters a century ago. In 1916, looters attempted to demolish the temple containing the mural, but were stopped in the nick of time by authorities. The only remaining evidence of the mural was photographs taken by Heinrich Brüning, an ethnographer. In 2018, Swiss archaeologist Sam Ghavami and his Peruvian colleague Christian Cancho were able to excavate the temple and uncover a 100-foot wall painted in brilliant colors. The mural depicts a procession of warriors marching towards a deity with birdlike features, and is said to be an important transitional phase in northern Peruvian art.</li>

<li>The Japanese company Eisai and its partner Biogen have developed the monoclonal antibody lecanemab to remove a protein called amyloid-beta in early-stage Alzheimer’s. Clinical trial results showed that lecanemab, given by intravenous infusion every other week, slowed the rate of cognitive decline by 27% in people taking it for 18 months, compared with similar participants on a placebo. While many scientists and advocates are hailing these results as a success, some neurologists are still questioning its safety and benefits, as there is a risk of brain swelling and brain hemorrhages, and the benefit of 0.45 points on the dementia scale is not clear. Further research is needed to determine the safety and efficacy of lecanemab before it can be recommended to patients with Alzheimer&#8217;s.</li>

There have been several vulnerabilities discovered, including ones that allow for the downloading and deleting of all files on a server and stealing of user passwords. There is a risk of a high-security vulnerability in the software ecosystem Mastodon relies on, though it has not yet been exploited. There is also a risk of DDoS attacks, hacking of accounts, and harassment and misinformation campaigns.</li>

<ul>
<li>Anatole France compared Marcel Proust to Bernardin and Petronius, suggesting that Proust reversed Bernardin&#8217;s preoccupation with the corruption of innocence and converted Petronius&#8217; sensualism into an aesthetic vocation. Proust&#8217;s work, In Search of Lost Time, was an ambitious four-thousand-page reconstruction of a life and a world, touching on the Dreyfus affair, anti-Semitism, and French nationalism. Finding Time Again, the final volume, was written in a new style due to the author&#8217;s failing health and the effects of World War I. The Modern Library editors used the work of Andreas Mayor, which was often colored by heavy editorial hand. In the book, Proust&#8217;s errors are often allowed to stand, and there is a sense of haste, due to the author&#8217;s pain and guilt over Alfred Agostinelli&#8217;s death and his own inversion. The narrator is often cruel in his assessment of the characters and their decadence, and Proust, in the end, was like Scheherazade, weaving by night and unweaving by day in a feverish nocturnal composition. His goal was to create a book like an optician&#8217;s magnifying glass, offering readers the means to read themselves and to chronicle individual peculiarities.</li>

<ul>
<li>The text discusses recent research into a series of gold Roman coins which had long been considered fake. The coins were found in 1713 and featured the image of an otherwise unknown leader named Sponsian. The new research suggests that the coins may in fact be authentic, based on evidence of wear and tear, as well as earthen deposits which suggest they were buried for a long time before being exhumed. If the coins are authentic, they would be of clear historical interest, as Sponsian is an otherwise obscure figure. However, some experts remain skeptical of the coins&#8217; authenticity.</li>

<ul>
<li>The text explains the findings of a study that showed that quantum coherence and quantum entanglement are &#8220;operationally equivalent.&#8221; This means that they are equivalent for all practical purposes, though still conceptually distinct. The study also showed that coherence and entanglement can be converted into each other. This discovery has several important implications, one of which is that all of the knowledge that researchers have obtained about entanglement can now be directly applied to coherence. The operational equivalence of coherence and entanglement will likely have a far-reaching impact on areas ranging from quantum information theory to more nascent fields such as quantum biology and nanoscale thermodynamics.</li>

<li>The study found that two species of mole - the European mole and the Spanish mole - change their skull size across seasons. The European mole shrinks its skull by eleven percent in winter and regrows it by four percent in spring, while the Spanish mole doesn&#8217;t change skull size at all throughout the year. The researchers concluded that weather, not food availability, was responsible for brain change.</li>

It explains that this concept is based on the notion that two organisms can benefit each other, and that it is necessary for the evolution of reciprocal altruism. The document also discusses how traditional conflict psychology sees altruistic behavior as a recent development, and how using this perspective, Trivers was able to perceive the conditions necessary for the evolution of reciprocal altruism within a context that includes individuals ready to exploit others.</li>

<li>It discusses the phenomenon of people faking or exaggerating illnesses online, known as &#8220;Munchausen by Internet&#8221; (MBI). It describes how people with MBI will often join online support groups and pretend to have a serious illness, often supported by photos borrowed from elsewhere on the Internet. It discusses how current subjects of MBI include a YouTuber who videos herself antagonizing customers and fainting in Walmart; a 20-something-year-old wellness influencer who swears by medical marijuana and posts about her bowel habits; an actress-turned-“professional patient” who twerks while receiving blood transfusions; and a teenager who wears crop tops to show off her feeding tubes. The document also discusses how the Reddit page Illness Fakers (IF) attempts to identify these individuals and discusses the reaction of the online disability community to the issue.</li>

<ul>
<li>The argonaut octopus has evolved the ability to produce a floating shell-like structure to care for its offspring. This shell-like structure is made of a mineral formula that is seceted by the octopus using two of its arms. The shell-like structure can grow to nearly a foot in length and can hold more than 40,000 embryos. The argonaut octopus crawls inside its shell-like purse, traps some air bubbles inside, then uses its buoyancy to bob just beneath the surface of water in warm oceans around the world.
The argonaut octopus has evolved this ability independently, and not by reactivating archaic genes from the mollusk era. The argonaut octopus&#8217;s shell-like egg case didn&#8217;t evolve from the ancestral shell, but it is the argonauts’ own evolutionary innovation for a new purpose.
The findings also feed into a debate over whether the argonaut’s egg case should really be called a shell. Michael Vecchione of the National Museum of Natural History wishes people wouldn&#8217;t call it a shell because there’s a major difference in how it’s constructed.
Other mollusks make their shells with mantle tissue secreted by a gland, Dr. Vecchione said, whereas the arm tips of A. argo secrete the argonaut’s shell material.
He hopes these novel findings will finally convince people to stop calling it a shell and start a rebrand.
Beyond the shell debate, Dr. Setiamarga and colleagues’ new genome sequence may help scientists understand more about how argonauts evolved to be pelagic, or living in open waters, and not benthic, like other octopuses who prefer the depths.</li>

<ul>
<li>A book review of &#8220;Novelist as a Vocation&#8221; by Haruki Murakami. The reviewer summarizing the book states that it is a collection of essays that offer insight into Murakami&#8217;s profession, and that the author is at pains to stress that these are simply his own thoughts and experiences and that he is not really giving advice at all. The reviewer goes on to say that, despite his success, Murakami remains painfully self-effacing, telling us that he is “ordinary” and unintelligent, and he often seems to be baffled (and even troubled) by what he has achieved. The reviewer also states that the book is notably bereft of personal detail and it is filled, instead, with already well-established moments from his life—a handful of stories he has rehashed endlessly in interviews and essays, perhaps hoping to deflect any meaningful inquiry into his life.</li>

<ul>
<li>In short, researchers are suggesting that the GW190521 black hole merger may have been the product of two black holes finding each other in the vastness of space, rather than the product of two massive stars that formed as a binary system. This is based on the fact that the GW190521 signal did not fit templates especially well and only matched best if the black holes involved weren&#8217;t spinning at all. The chirp was unusually short, and there is no sign of a signal prior to the actual merger. Finally, both of the objects involved in the merger were relatively massive: about 50 and 80 times the mass of the Sun. Black holes of this size don&#8217;t form in supernovae (those typically start out with less than 15 solar masses), so these are likely the products of prior collisions.</li>

<li>The organization recently changed how it analyses data, switching from five-yearly to annual intervals. And there has been a steady improvement in recent decades in the ability and capacity of many countries to collect statistics. The UN predicts that global population will be about 9.5 billion in 2100. The institute is now preparing an update, which will raise that estimate to between 10 billion and 10.1 billion. The change is due to higher observed and expected survival rates among children in lower-income countries, Sobotka says. Another factor is higher estimates of fertility rates in some large countries, including Pakistan.</li>
